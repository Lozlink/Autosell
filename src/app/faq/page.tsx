  {
    question: "How quickly can I get a quote?",
    answer: "Our AI-powered system typically provides quotes within 30 minutes of submitting your car details. During business hours, many quotes are available in just 10-15 minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you really pay on the same day?",
    answer: "Yes! Once we inspect your vehicle and complete the paperwork, we transfer the money directly to your bank account via OSKO, which typically processes within minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my car isn't running?",
    answer: "No problem! We buy cars in all conditions - running or not, damaged or perfect. We'll arrange towing if needed and still provide competitive offers."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. Our quote is what you get paid. We don't charge any fees, commissions, or deduct costs for paperwork, towing, or processing."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you determine the price?",
    answer: "We use real-time market data, RedBook valuations, and our extensive network of buyers to ensure you get the best possible price for your vehicle."
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you service?",
    answer: "We operate Australia-wide! From major cities to remote areas, we can arrange pickup and payment anywhere in Australia."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need?",
    answer: "You'll need your vehicle registration, driver's license, and proof of ownership. We'll help you with all the paperwork during the inspection."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my mind after accepting an offer?",
    answer: "Yes, you can change your mind up until we complete the final paperwork and payment. However, once payment is made, the sale is final."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you buy all car brands?",
    answer: "Yes! We buy all makes and models - Toyota, Ford, Holden, BMW, Mercedes, and everything in between. No car is too old or too new."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I still owe money on my car?",
    answer: "We can still buy your car even if you have a loan. We'll work with your lender to pay off the loan and give you any remaining equity."
